OpenBOR Engine for Sega Dreamcast
=================================

OpenBOR is a royalty free sprite based side scrolling gaming engine, based on
the source code of the Beats of Rage game published by Senile Team back in 2004.
Beats of Rage is an open-source 2D customisable video game engine inspired by
Sega's classic Streets of Rage series of beat'em up games.

From humble beginnings, OpenBOR Engine has since grown into the most versatile,
easy to use, and powerful engine of its type you will find anywhere. OpenBOR is
optimized for side scrolling beat em’ up style games (Double Dragon, Streets of
Rage, Final Fight...), but easily accommodates any sort of gameplay style and
feature set you can imagine.

Usage
=====

To use the compiled OpenBOR Engine binary on your Sega Dreamcast, you'll need a
Sega Dreamcast compatible BOR.PAK containing the game content of your choice.

To generate a selfboot disc image:

1. Put the BOR.PAK file of your choice in the cd_root directory.
2. Just double-click on the included makedisc.cmd script.
3. Your OpenBOR Engine game disc is now ready, you can burn it or use it in the
   Demul emulator.
